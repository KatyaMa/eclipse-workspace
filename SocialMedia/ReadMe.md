Packages are written in lowercase with each word separated by dots, and includes the name of the project and the name of the developer.
Core Java and Models:

The project utilizes Java classes with constant variables and at least four models corresponding to tables in a relational database.
Exception handling is implemented.
Database, ORM, and Hibernate:

## MySQL is used as the DBMS.
A schema diagram of the tables and the SQL used for the database is included.
The database configuration file is set up correctly in the Spring application through “spring initializr” (application.properties).
Custom queries are included.
Hibernate is used directly or through Spring Data JPA.
The project includes examples for all four CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, and Delete).
Front-end Development:

## CSS is used to style the web pages, with an external CSS stylesheet included.

Dependency injection is implemented with appropriate use of the @Autowired annotation.
The project includes an example of session management and transaction and request/response logging.
Web Services (JAX-WS, JAX-RS, or Spring REST) are implemented.
Sign-up and login functionality is included with hashing passwords using bcrypt.
Unit Testing:

Each query method created in the repositories is tested.
At least one method in each service class is tested.
## Conclusion:
This Kids Social Media Project is a fully functional application designed for kids, which follows the given rubric and utilizes various technologies like Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, Hibernate, and JUnit for testing. The project structure, naming conventions, and database schema are properly defined, and the project includes all four CRUD operations, custom queries, and session management. The front-end development includes CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and a navigation section, making the project more user-friendly.
